Nmap has become one of the most popular tools in network scanning by leaving other scanners behind. Many times, the hosts in some organisations are secured using firewalls or intrusion prevention systems which result in the failure of scanning due to the present set of rules which are used to block network traffic.
In Nmap, a pentester can easily make use of alternate host discovery techniques to prevent this from happening. It consists of certain features that make the network traffic a little less suspicious. Hence, in this report, various techniques of Host Discovery will be explored.

## Wfuzz

Many tools have been developed that create an HTTP request and allow a user to modify their contents. Fuzzing works the same way. A user can send a similar request multiple times to the server with a certain section of the request changed. When that certain section is replaced by a variable from a list or directory, it is called fuzzing.
