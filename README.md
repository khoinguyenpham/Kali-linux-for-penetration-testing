Nmap has become one of the most popular tools in network scanning by leaving
other scanners behind. Many times, the hosts in some organisations are secured
using firewalls or intrusion prevention systems which result in the failure of
scanning due to the present set of rules which are used to block network traffic.
In Nmap, a pentester can easily make use of alternate host discovery techniques to
prevent this from happening. It consists of certain features that make the network
traffic a little less suspicious. Hence, in this report, various techniques of Host
Discovery will be explored.
