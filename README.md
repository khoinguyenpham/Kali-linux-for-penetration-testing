Nmap has become one of the most popular tools in network scanning by leaving other scanners behind. Many times, the hosts in some organisations are secured using firewalls or intrusion prevention systems which result in the failure of scanning due to the present set of rules which are used to block network traffic.
In Nmap, a pentester can easily make use of alternate host discovery techniques to prevent this from happening. It consists of certain features that make the network traffic a little less suspicious. Hence, in this report, various techniques of Host Discovery will be explored.

## Metasploit

Metasploit is the world's leading open-source penetrating framework used by security engineers as a penetration testing system and a development platform that allows to create security tools and exploits.

## Wfuzz

Many tools have been developed that create an HTTP request and allow a user to modify their contents. Fuzzing works the same way. A user can send a similar request multiple times to the server with a certain section of the request changed. When that certain section is replaced by a variable from a list or directory, it is called fuzzing.

## Hydra

Hydra - a very fast network logon cracker which supports many different services. It is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. New modules are easy to add, besides that, it is flexible and very fast. This tool gives researchers and security
consultants the possibility to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a system.

## Burp Suite

Burp is an essential offensive security tool. It is used by a majority of professionals (including us pentesters) and is dedicated mainly to pentesting web applications.

## Kerbrute

Kerbrute is a tool used to enumerate valid Active directory user accounts that using kerrberos pre-authentication. Also, this tool can be used to password attacks such as password bruteforce, username enumeration, password spray etc. This tool is being used for many years by penetration testers during
internal penetration testing engagements. This tool is originally written by Ronnie Flathers (ropnop)
with contributor Alex Flores.

## Netcat

Netcat technically used as “nc” – is a network utility that uses the TCP and UDP connections in order to read and write in a network. It can be used by both the attackers and the security auditors.
